# Dates
The Critique Manager has two dates but they are displayed in multiple formats on the form. The Start date and time of the monthly session, the end time of the session and the Deadline date.

## Format <br>
All dates can be displayed in any valid date format supported by Google Sheets. To set the display format for any of the dates, select the date cell, and then click the Format > Number menu options. Previously used date formats will appear at the bottom of the menu list. If the format you are looking for does not appear in this list, select the More Formats > More date and time formats option.

The default options can be changed, removed or placed in a different order. Clicking the drop down arrow (1) will display more options to select from.
