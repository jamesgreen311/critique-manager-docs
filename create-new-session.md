# Create a New Critique Session

Creating a new session for a month is currently a manual process. Each month's attendance roster is a new sheet in the Critique Sign Up Sheet (Responses) spreadsheet. To start a new session it's a matter of duplicating an existing month's sheet and renaming it to the new session month and year. Any data from the previous month should be removed, but only the registered users data. The sheet also contains two pivot tables and they shouldn't be deleted. Registered user data is in columns A - M at the time of this writing.

## Config
The Config tab contains the setup information for the month's critque.

### Set the Dates
Change the Critique Start date to the date and time for the session. Change the Critique End date to match the Critique Start date. By default the duration should already be at two hours, so the end time should already be set correctly. 

### Date Formats
All date formatting is done using the Google Sheets date format options. To have a date and or time display on the form in the format you wish, you would modify the date using the Format > Number options. These shouldn't need to change unless you want them displayed differently on the form. See [Dates](../dates) for details on formatting dates
